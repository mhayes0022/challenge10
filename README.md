# Challenge10
Logo Generator

## Page Description

This is an SVG logo generator. When you run the index.js file in VS code, you will be prompted with a series of questions. It will begin by asking you to choose three alphanumeric characters, then ask you what color you would like your characters to be. Then, you are prompted to choose one of the three following shapes: triangle, square, or circle. Lastly, you are asked to choose a color for your shape. When these questions have been answered, the application will use the user input to create an SVG file containing a logo which meets the specifications the user has selected.

## Demonstration



## Credits

This application was created by me for a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp run through the University of Minnesota. While there was no starter code provided for this challenge, I was given very helpful feedback by a tutor.
